# D&D v3.5 VCS

A Virtual Character Sheet Management program for D&D v3.5. This code simply establishes the library for us to use in another program that utilizes the D&D 3.5 system.

## Getting Started

This project uses the C++ Standard Libraries and is not platform-dependent; therefore, it can be compiled using any UNIX or DOS compiler. `main.cpp` is the main file, and each class and file format has its own `.h` and `.cpp` file. Note the `main.cpp` file is currently empty. The file `RKS-35.h` is the library include; including this file in a project will allow you to use all the functions in the program.
